Approach: I first initialized small and secsmall using the first two elements of the array, ensuring they are assigned correctly based on their values.
Then, I iterated through the rest of the array, updating small and secsmall

Learnings: Efficient tracking of both the smallest and second smallest elements in a single array.
Additionally, handling edge of duplicate cases was also learnt.
