Approach: the fgets captures full lines of text, accommodating multiple words and spaces.
The compression logic operates by iterating through the input string and comparing each character to its predecessor;
if they are different, the character is added to the compressed output.
Additionally, the code counts how many characters are removed during this process.

Learnings: selecting appropriate input methods. String manipulation to recieve desired output.
