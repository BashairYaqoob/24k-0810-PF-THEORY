Approach: The program generates the random 6*5 array, prints it in a tabular format, and then allows the user to search for strings within the array.
The search function checks both horizontal (left to right) and vertical (top to bottom) directions to locate the string.
Each successful search increases the score, while an unsuccessful search decreases it. Input "END" re-populates array.

Learning: Handling two-dimensional arrays, generating random values, and string manipulation in C.
