Approach: rules: players can take between 1 to 4 matchsticks, and the player who takes the last matchstick wins.
A's losing position occurs when there are exactly 5 matchsticks (n%5==0), as any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.
Conversely, if N is not a multiple of 5, the first player *A* can force the opponent into a losing position by picking n%5 matchsticks.

Learning: Use of modular arithmetic to recognize patterns, problem-solving.
