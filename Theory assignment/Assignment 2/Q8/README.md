Approach: The main function displays a menu and prompts the user to select a conversion option.
Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding function is called, and input is collected as needed.
Each conversion function performs the necessary calculations and prints the result. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit.

Learning: Numerical conversions implementation in C using functions.
It demonstrates the use of different data types (integers and strings) and control structures (loops and switch statements) to handle user input and perform operations based on it.
