Approach: The 5x5 grid have cells that can either be empty, contain an item, or have an obstacle.
The player's position is represented by 'P', and the goal is for the player to move around the grid('W' for up, 'S' for down, 'A' for left, and 'D' for right).
The program first prints the grid, and after each move, it updates the playerâ€™s position and checks whether the player has encountered an item or an obstacle.
If an item is collected, the score increases, and the game continues until the player chooses to quit by pressing 'Q'.

Learning: How to handle grid navigation in a programmatic way, manage game rules such as preventing players from moving out of bounds or into obstacles,
and work with simple input validation.
