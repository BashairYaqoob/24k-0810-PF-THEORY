Approach: . First, sort the characters in each string using bubble sort.
Store the sorted versions in a separate array. Then, iterate through the original transactions, comparing their sorted forms to group together those that are anagrams.
Use an additional array to track which transactions have already been grouped to avoid duplicates.
Finally, print each group of anagrams together.

Learning: String manipulation and basic data structures to effectively organize the transactions.
